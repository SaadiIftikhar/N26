### 6. Install the Monefy App on Emulator

1. **Locate the APK:**
   - Once emulator is running. Ensure the `monefy.apk` file is located at:
     ```
     ..\N26\SecondTask\monefy.apk
     ```

2. **Install the APK:**
   - Open a PowerShell window and run:

## üöÄ Running Maestro Test Flows

With the emulator running and the Monefy app installed, you can execute the test flows.

1. **Navigate to the Flows Directory:**
   - Open a PowerShell window and navigate to the flows directory:
     ```powershell
     cd ..\N26\SecondTask\flows
     ```

2. **Run Individual Test Flows:**

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Overview

### Scalability and Maintainability

The test automation framework is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind. Here are the key aspects that contribute to this:

- **Modular Test Design**: Each test flow is defined in separate YAML files, allowing for easy addition or modification of test cases without affecting other flows. This modularity simplifies maintenance and enhances readability.

- **Reusable Components**: Common actions and assertions are encapsulated in reusable functions within the `elements` directory. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to update the logic in one place.

- **Clear Structure**: The project follows a clear directory structure, separating test flows, element definitions, and configuration files. This organization helps new contributors quickly understand the project layout.

### Approach and Tech Stack

The chosen tech stack for this automation framework includes:

- **Maestro**: A powerful tool for automating mobile applications, which allows for easy interaction with UI elements and supports various testing scenarios. Its YAML-based configuration makes it user-friendly and accessible for non-developers.

- **Java**: The framework leverages Java for its robustness and widespread use in the industry. Java's strong typing and object-oriented features help in building a reliable and maintainable codebase.

- **Android Studio**: This IDE provides a comprehensive environment for developing and testing Android applications, making it easier to manage the Android SDK and emulator.

The combination of these technologies ensures that the framework is not only effective in executing tests but also easy to extend and maintain as the application evolves.
